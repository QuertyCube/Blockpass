## Introduction
Blockpass is a decentralized event management system that ensures a secure, transparent, and trustless ticketing experience.

With blockchain technology at its core, users can seamlessly purchase tickets with full confidence, knowing that their transactions are immutable and verifiable. Event organizers benefit from a tamper-proof system that prevents fraud, scalping, and unauthorized resales. Every ticket is securely stored on the blockchain as an NFT, providing authenticity and ownership verification.

By leveraging smart contracts, our platform enables real-time ticket issuance, automated pricing adjustments, and seamless secondary market trading—all while maintaining transparency and fairness. Whether you're hosting concerts, conferences, or exclusive events, our decentralized ticketing system revolutionizes the way tickets are issued, sold, and validated.
